          </h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          I have said many times that computer science is a huge field in which
          everyone can find themselves. Being a computer science student has its
          advantages and benefits, and one such advantage is what GitHub offers
          with its GitHub for Education program and the GitHub Student Developer
          Pack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GitHub Student Developer Pack gives students access to the tools
          companies use in their development. GitHub and its partners are aware
          of this and make it possible for students to get these tools.
        </p>

        <h2
          id="heading-how-do-i-get-access-to-the-github-student-developer-pack"
        >
          How do I get access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack?
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you don't have a GitHub profile yet, just create one on the GitHub
          website. I recommend that you create a GitHub account with your
          personal email address and add your school email address to the
          account.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have a GitHub user account, visit the GitHub Education website
          and click the "Sign up for Student Developer Pack" button
        </p>

        <p>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698951861045/04b024d2-06ec-40bb-97c6-724ba97a12c6.png"
            alt
            class="image--center mx-auto"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next step, a new page will open, on which you can click "Get
          student benefits".
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698951896695/4eda0d97-a60a-4e4a-bcb1-6d7924d38196.png"
            alt
            class="image--center mx-auto"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          A form with three questions will open. In the first question, you
          select the appropriate school email address. The next question can be
          filled in automatically, or you will need to enter the school's name
          manually. The last question is what is your purpose for using GitHub?
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698952029079/e7c7986d-7ba2-448b-922c-0e2f22687e60.png"
            alt
            class="image--center mx-auto"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          GitHub can now ask you to upload a certificate or proof that you are
          indeed a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your request will be processed within one week. As soon as your
          application is approved, you will be able to start using GitHub for
          students benefits.
        </p>
        <h2 id="heading-what-benefits-does-the-package-bring-me">

          partners. Just bravely try the benefits of the package.
