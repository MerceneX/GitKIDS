        </div>

        <p><strong>Gragas</strong>, the Rabble Rouser, is a tanky and versatile champion in <strong>League of Legends</strong>. Known for his love of brewing and drinking ale, Gragas brings chaos to the battlefield with his explosive barrels and unpredictable crowd control. Whether played as a top-lane bruiser, a jungle initiator, or even an off-meta support, Gragas offers disruptive power in both casual and professional play.</p>

        <h2>Champion Lore</h2>
        <p>Gragas is an enormous, rowdy brewmaster who hails from the mountains of Freljord. He is on a personal quest to craft the perfect pint of ale, and his experiments often lead to wild misadventures. His journey has taken him to every corner of Runeterra, as he searches for rare ingredients and techniques. Wherever he goes, Gragas leaves behind a trail of broken kegs and shattered mugs. Despite his gruff and reckless nature, he’s a beloved figure who enjoys sharing his drinks with anyone willing to keep up with his wild parties.</p>

        <h2>Gragas' Abilities</h2>
        <p>Gragas’s abilities revolve around his mastery of brewing and his massive barrel, which he uses to both protect his allies and wreak havoc on his enemies. His kit makes him a versatile pick, combining burst damage, crowd control, and durability. Below is a breakdown of his abilities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passive - Happy Hour:</strong> After casting an ability, Gragas restores a percentage of his maximum health.</li>
            <li><strong>Q - Barrel Roll:</strong> Gragas throws a cask that rolls to a location, exploding after a short delay and slowing enemies. It deals more damage the longer it ferments.</li>
            <li><strong>W - Drunken Rage:</strong> Gragas drinks from his cask, reducing incoming damage and empowering his next basic attack to deal bonus damage.</li>
            <li><strong>E - Body Slam:</strong> Gragas charges forward, colliding with the first enemy he hits. This knocks them back and stuns them.</li>
            <li><strong>R - Explosive Cask:</strong> Gragas hurls his cask to a location, dealing magic damage to all enemies in the area and knocking them away from the explosion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gragas' Role in the Game</h2>
        <p>Gragas is typically played in one of three roles: as a tanky top-laner, a bruiser in the jungle, or a disruptive AP damage dealer. His ability to engage with <em>Body Slam</em> and his ultimate, <em>Explosive Cask</em>, makes him an excellent teamfighter. His passive healing and <em>Drunken Rage</em> allow him to soak up damage and stay in fights longer, while his <em>Barrel Roll</em> and ultimate provide zoning and disengage tools for his team.</p>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Excellent crowd control with multiple forms of CC.</li>
            <li>High sustain due to his passive.</li>
            <li>Great zoning and engage tools for teamfights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Skillshot-reliant abilities.</li>
            <li>Can struggle in prolonged fights against sustained damage dealers.</li>
            <li>Limited mobility outside of <em>Body Slam</em>.</li>
        </ul>
