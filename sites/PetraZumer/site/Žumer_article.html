                        Egypt is full of 'bucket list' experiences. The most famous of these
                        would easily be the Great Pyramids of Giza near the capital city of Cairo, but
                        there are also some other 'must see' sights in central and southern Egypt. Top
                        sights in my opinion would have to include the archaeological museums and temples
                        of Luxor, and the incredible pharaoh statues and ancient tombs at Abu Simbel.

                        Japan is an amazing combination of old and new, modern and traditional.
                        You can ride a futuristic bullet train through the city, and visit a medieval Samurai
                        castle in the same day. There is a huge variety of cultural attractions here, both
                        old and new. We love traveling in Japan. The transportation is efficient, the people
                        are polite, and the toilets are computerized. Osaka is a smart place to start; it's
                        great for trying street food, shopping for weird and unique souvenirs, visiting
                        Samurai castles, and getting a feel for what Japan is like.

                        The Philippines is a great place for island hopping and scuba diving,
                        with over 7,000 islands full of white sand beaches, rainbow corals, and turquoise
                        waterfalls. One of the best known islands is Palawan, which has been ranked as the
                        most beautiful island in the world. The island of Bohol is also popular for its
                        exotic scenery and scuba diving. Read through this complete Philippines travel guide
